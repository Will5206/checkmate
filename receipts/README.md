# Receipts Folder

This folder contains test receipt images for the receipt parser.

## Usage

Place your receipt image files (PNG, JPG, etc.) in this folder.

The receipt parser script (`reciept_parser_local.py`) looks for images in this directory.

## Example

To test with a receipt image:
1. Place your receipt image file here (e.g., `example_rec_3.png`)
2. Update the filename in `reciept_parser_local.py` if needed
3. Run the script
